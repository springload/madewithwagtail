=================

> A showcase of sites and apps made with [Wagtail](https://wagtail.io/): an easy to use, open source content management system from [Torchbox](https://github.com/torchbox/wagtail).

## Installation

Install [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) and [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads), then from the command-line:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:springload/madewithwagtail.git
cd madewithwagtail
vagrant up
# [.. wait until everything gets installed]
vagrant ssh
# [.. from your vagrant machine]
djrun
```

The demo site will now be accessible at [http://localhost:8111/](http://localhost:8111/) and the Wagtail admin interface at [http://localhost:8111/admin/](http://localhost:8111/admin/) . Log into the admin with the credentials ``admin / changeme``.

### Front-end commands

> Everything mentioned in the installation process should already be done.

```sh
# Make sure you use the right node version.
nvm use
# Start the server and the development tools.
npm run start
# Builds frontend assets.
npm run build
# Runs linting.

### Adding and upgrading dependencies

This project is [shrinkwrapped](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/shrinkwrap). Its dependencies are locked down in `npm-shrinkwrap.json` file. To update them,

1. Use `npm run lint:versions` to confirm you are using the right node version.
2. Use `npm install <package>` with `--save` or `--save-dev` options to change the dependencies.
3. Check the project still works with the new dependencies / new versions.
4. Run **`npm run lock`** to regenerate `npm-shrinkwrap.json`.
5. Commit this file, and push.

## Deploying a new version

### To production

```sh
npm run deploy
```

From your local machine, it's a good idea to push to the master before
pushing to the deploy branch. That way you know that both are up to date.

### New site submissions workflow

Anyone can submit a site on the [submission form](http://madewithwagtail.org/submit/). When a new site is submitted, the details are saved and also sent to us via an email notification. We then need to manually validate the submission and add the new site via the CMS.

- Check that the submission is valid (site exists, isn't obviously built with something else).
- If the submission isn't valid, we won't add the site to our showcase. Send an email to the person making the submission to let their know.
- If the submission is valid,

## Valid submissions

1. Take a 1440x1200 screenshot of the site's homepage with [`screenshotron`](https://github.com/springload/screenshotron).
2. Log into the CMS at http://madewithwagtail.org/admin/login
3. Check if the developer already has a page in the CMS.
4. If not, create a page for the company or individual with their details.
5. Add a new Site page under this Developer, with the details that are in the submission.
6. Use the screenshot for the "Desktop image".
7. Add tags that you deem appropriate, depending on the ones we already have and the characteristics of the site.
8. Publish!
9. Let the submitter know by sending them a nice email.
